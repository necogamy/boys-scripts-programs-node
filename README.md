# **Boys programs scripts**
## **Here are two programs, badboy.js and fetcherboy.js**
### *Made for requesting API data and exclusive use with node*

<br>

## **Features**
* Bad Boy: Made to obtain IP where is executed and if you want IP data
* Fetcher Boy: Made to request an API with user-friendly in mind, just put and API between the quotes in the API variable and execute the program, and boom

# **Note for Bad Boy**
* I'm not owner of the API's
* The program was not done with bad purposes, I only made the program with API usage and it only can obtain local IP and local data
